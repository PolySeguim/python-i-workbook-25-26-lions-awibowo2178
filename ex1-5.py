Exercise 5:  Bottle Deposits
In many jurisdictions a small deposit is added to drink 
containers to encourage people to recycle them.  In one 
particular jurisdiction, drink containers holding one liter

more than one liter have $0.25 deposit.

size from the user.  Your program should continue by computing 
and displaying the refund that will be received for returning 
those containers.  Format the output so that it includes a dollar
